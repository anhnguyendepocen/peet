<h2>Writing a New Game</h2>

<p>
Each game consists of two classes: a controller class, derived from the GameControl base class, which runs on the server, and a client interface class, derived from the GameGUI base class, which runs on the client.  To create a new game, one must write a controller class and a corresponding interface class.  The two must be named like (name)Control and (name)GUI, where (name) is a common prefix.  This naming convention is the only explicit link between the two.  I'll use TestControl and TestGUI for example.
</p>

<h3>Game controller</h3>

<p>All game controllers are subclasses of the GameControl class; see server/gamecontrollers/GameControl.py for documentation of all its methods, including those that subclasses must implement.</p>

<p>
Game controller classes are located in the server/gamecontrollers directory, which is a Python package.  Edit the file __init__.py in this directory so that the __all__ list contains the name of the new class (e.g. TestGUI).  Name the source file with the class name, e.g. TestGUI.py.  It will need to import servernet and GameControl and be a subclass of GameControl:
</p>

<pre>
import servernet
import GameControl

class TestControl(GameControl.GameControl):

    """Test game controller."""
</pre>

<p>
This class must have a few static variables:
</p>

<pre>
	# name is what appears in the drop-down menu for choosing the experiment
    # type in the parameter editor.
    # description is currently unused.
    name = "Test game controller"
    description = "A game controller just for testing."

    # customParams is a static variable, a dictionary that just gives the names,
    # default values, and descriptions of this controller's game-specific
    # parameters.  The dictionary is indexed by parameter name, and each element
    # is a tuple containing the default value and the description, which appears
    # as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the name in the parameter editor.
    customParams = {}
    customParams['numGroups'] = 1, "Number of groups"
</pre>

<p>
GameControl defines a member variable called initParams, which is a list of dictionaries containing initialization parameters to be sent to each client (one dictionary for each client).  These can be added to before being sent to the clients.
The __init__ method must initialize the GameControl superclass and set any additional initialization parameters:
</p>

<pre>
    def __init__(self, server, params, communicator, clients, outputDir):
        GameControl.GameControl.__init__(self, server, params, communicator,
                clients, outputDir)

        for client in self.clients:
            self.initParams[client.id]['greeting'] = \
                    "Hello, client " + ' ' + str(client.id)

        self.server.enableChat()
</pre>

<p>
Above, client chat is enabled.  (It is disabled by default.)
</p>

<p>
The next method to implement is initMatch().  This does

<h3>wxPython</h3>

<p>
This application's GUI is written in <a href="http://wxpython.org/">wxPython</a>, and the client interface classes are generally written in wxPython (although another toolkit could be used instead).
</p>

<ul>

<li>There are a number of wxPython tutorials on the web that are a good place to start.</li>

<li>The <a href="http://docs.wxwidgets.org/stable/wx_contents.html">wxWidgets documentation</a> seems to be the most comprehensive reference documentation available.  Although it is written for the C++ wxWidgets library, the Python API is a fairly direct translation.  I use it in conjunction with:</li>

<li>The <a href="http://wxpython.org/docs/api/">wxPython API documentation</a> is the up-and-coming Python-specific wx documentation.  As of this writing, it is incomplete, but can still be helpful.  It can help in translating the more detailed C++ documentation into Python terms.</li>

<li>The wxPython Demo application that comes with wxPython conveniently demonstrates the use of the classes in the library, although the comments in the demo code can be a little thin.</li>

<li>Avoid using wx.ListCtrl if possible.  It's a pain to figure out.  The rest of wx is pretty straightforward.</li>

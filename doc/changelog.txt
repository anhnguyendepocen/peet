2009-04-13
	* When message sending is idle for 2 seconds, clients ping server to let
	them know they are alive.  Server considers clients disconnected after
	10 seconds with no message.  (Before this, server would not notice if
	client was physically unplugged, because the socket was never closed.)

2009-02-24

2009-01-12
	* cleaned up directory structure, making client.py and server.py the
	only top-level files, and separating the rest into client, server,
	shared, etc. directories
	* changed controller and GUI class import method to avoid "import *"
	* before connecting to clients, check for valid controller class name in
	parameters, so that exec and eval will be secure.

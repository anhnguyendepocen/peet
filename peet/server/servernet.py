"""
Threads to handle server-client communication - server side

The public interface consists of the classes
  Communicator
  ClientConnection

Every message is a dictionary, assumed to have at least a 'type' key.
Communicator pickles before sending and unpickles after receiving.  Messages
are communicated to the server through the postEvent method that the server
passes in.  If the message['type'] is 'gm' (for Game Message), then the
message is also put on a queue for retrieval by the game controller using the
recv() and recv_nowait() methods.

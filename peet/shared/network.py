Networking code common to client and server

The main purpose is to define functions to send and receive whole messages, one
at a time, without losing any.  There is a subtle problem one encounters when
trying to send messages over sockets: sockets (at least TCP sockets) transfer
data in streams, not discrete messages (well, thinking above the packet level).
That means that each send() is not necessarily matched with exactly one
corresponding recv() on the other end, and vice versa.  For example, if the
server sends two messages in quick succession, they may both be sitting in the
client's receive buffer, and the client's call to recv() will return both
messages concatenated together.  When the client unpickles this, any pickled
representations in the data buffer after the first one will be discarded,
resulting in lost messages.  It's also possible to receive a partial message,
which cannot be unpickled without calling recv() again and waiting for the rest.

These functions prefix each message with its length to make sure they get
through whole and nothing gets discarded.

Also, SenderThread is defined in this file, because there are no differences
between how client and server do the sending part.  ListenerThread, however, is
defined separately for server (servernet.py) and client (clientnet.py)
